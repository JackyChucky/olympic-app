# An app all about the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, postponed to Summer 2021!

This is the Student Branch of the Olympic App, which we can build together at Microsoft Build. Welcome, students and learners of all type.

To get started, fork this version of the app and open it in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Look for the medal emoji to follow the steps and build this app. The complete app is built on the main branch.

To launch the app, use the terminal in VS Code and type `npm run dev`.

Using Vite, Vanilla JS, and CSS Grid, let's create a card-flipping app!

Vite will handle the architecture and module bundling, we will use Vanilla JS to avoid framework fatigue, and use CSS Grid for responsive design needs. The actual card flipping can be done using plain old CSS transforms.
